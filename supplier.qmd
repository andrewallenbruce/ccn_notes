Suppliers that are paid by Part B carriers have a 10-digit alphanumeric CCN. The
first 2 digits identify the State in which the supplier is located. The third
digit is an alpha character that identifies the type of facility. The remaining
7 digits are the unique facility identifier.

The following characters in the third position indicate:

   * `C` [ASC]: Ambulatory Surgical Centers
   * `D` [CLIA]: Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) Laboratories
   * `X` [PXRF]: Portable X-Ray Facilities

The last 7 digits of the CCN for the above suppliers will be within the number
series `0000001-9999999`.
