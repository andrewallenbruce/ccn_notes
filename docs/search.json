The NPI1 and PTAN2 are tied to an entity’s CCN. The RO3, not the SA4 or MAC5, assigns the CCN and maintains adequate controls.\nA canonically valid CCN is an alphanumeric string, either 6 or 10 characters in length, that encodes a provider/supplier’s state and facility type.",

    "text": "6.3 Details\n\nHospital-Based Renal Dialysis Facilities, [2300, 2499]: The physical location of an ESRD facility on the premises of a hospital is not considered when determining if the ESRD facility is hospital-based. Hospital corporate control is a critical factor in determining whether an ESRD facility is hospital-based. Hospitals may have a lease arrangement for the management of a hospital-based ESRD facility by a non-hospital manager. This CCN range is used for ESRD facilities that have been determined by the CMS to be hospital-owned, hospital-administered ESRD facilities physically located on the hospital’s premises as opposed to independent ESRD facilities and Hospital-Based Renal Disease Satellite Facilities. The satellites are hospital-based, but are physically located off the hospital’s premises.\n\nHospital-Based Renal Dialysis Satellite Facilities, [3500, 3699]: This CCN range is used for those ESRD facilities that are hospital-owned and hospital-administered, but that are not located on the hospital’s premises. This is why they are referred to as hospital-based satellites. In determining whether such a satellite facility is hospital-based, use the same criteria as you would in making a hospital-based determination under the 2300-2499 series, except that you would assign a 3500-3699 number to such a facility because it is off the premises of the hospital to which it is based. The word premises per se is not defined in the statute, regulations, or SOM[^State Operations Manual], but there is a definition of “furnishes on the premises” that states “the ESRD facility furnishes services on its main premises; or its other premises that are:\n\nContiguous with or in immediate proximity to the main premises, and under the direction of the same professional staff and governing body as the main premises, or\nApproved on a time-limited basis as a special purpose renal dialysis facility.”\n\n\n\nThus, in addition to the regulations, which should assist you in determining whether the facility is an integral part of the hospital, you may use the “furnishes on the premises” definition to distinguish between a hospital-based entity under the 2300-2499 series as opposed to an entity under the 3500-3699 number series. Also, we do not believe that these satellites will be furnishing inpatient dialysis services. The CMS will make or approve the determination that a particular ESRD facility meets the requirements to be hospital-based, and if it is off the hospital’s premises, a hospital- based satellite. It is conceivable that a hospital-based ESRD facility could have a 2300-2499 number assigned to the location on the hospital’s premises, and one or more 3500-3699 numbers for those locations (satellites) off the premises (each satellite is given a separate 3500- 3699 number). If an ESRD facility that is assigned a 2300-2499 number moves off the hospital’s premises and is determined to be a satellite, it should receive a number in the 3500-3699 series. However, if a satellite changes its address but is still considered off the hospital’s premises, it should retain the 3500-3699 number it was originally issued rather than being issued a new 3500-3699 number. Any questions concerning billing should be referred to the RO financial component or the fiscal intermediary as you determine appropriate.\nNOTE: In determining whether an entity is hospital-based for reimbursement purposes, the requirements at §2287 must be met.",
